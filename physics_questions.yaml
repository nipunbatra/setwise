- answer: 'From the first equation: $t = \frac{v-u}{a}$


    Substituting into the second equation:

    $s = u \cdot \frac{v-u}{a} + \frac{1}{2}a \left(\frac{v-u}{a}\right)^2$


    Simplifying:

    $s = \frac{u(v-u)}{a} + \frac{(v-u)^2}{2a}$


    $s = \frac{2u(v-u) + (v-u)^2}{2a} = \frac{(v-u)(2u + v - u)}{2a} = \frac{(v-u)(v+u)}{2a}$


    $s = \frac{v^2 - u^2}{2a}$


    Therefore: $v^2 = u^2 + 2as$'
