| 10 questions | <0.01s | ✅ Excellent |
| 100 questions | 0.02s | ✅ Excellent |
| 500 questions | 0.09s | ✅ Good |
| 1000 questions | ~0.18s | ✅ Acceptable |

#### Generation Performance
| Question Count | Generation Time | Grade |
|----------------|----------------|--------|
| 10 questions | <0.01s | ✅ Excellent |
| 100 questions | 0.02s | ✅ Excellent |
| 500 questions | 0.09s | ✅ Good |
| 1000 questions | ~0.20s | ✅ Acceptable |

#### Memory Usage
- **Baseline**: ~15MB for core application
- **100 questions**: ~18MB (+3MB)
- **500 questions**: ~25MB (+10MB)
- **Memory efficiency**: Linear scaling with question count

### Performance Optimization

#### Current Optimizations
- Lazy loading of question libraries
- Efficient template compilation caching
- Minimal memory footprint design
- Optimized LaTeX validation algorithms

#### Scalability Limits
- **Recommended**: Up to 500 questions per file for optimal performance
- **Maximum tested**: 1000 questions (still functional)
- **Memory limit**: Depends on system, typically 1000+ questions
- **PDF compilation**: LaTeX memory limits may apply for very large quizzes

## Validation Features

### Enhanced LaTeX Validation

#### Smart Detection
```python
# Detects math expressions missing $ delimiters
"x^2 + y^2" → Error: "Math expression 'x^2' should be in math mode: $x^2$"

# Recognizes chemistry formulas
"H2O" → Suggestion: "Chemistry formula 'H2O' should use subscripts: H$_2$O"

# Identifies physics units
"45 degrees" → Suggestion: "Physics unit '45 degrees' can be improved: 45°"
```

#### Auto-Fix Capabilities
```bash
# Preview fixes
setwise questions fix-latex questions.yaml --dry-run

# Common fixes applied automatically:
# - H2O → H$_2$O
# - x^2 → $x^{2}$
# - 45 degrees → 45°
# - % → \%
```

### Contextual Suggestions

#### Smart Guidance System
- **Format-specific**: YAML indentation, JSON quotes, CSV escaping
- **Content quality**: Question length, missing marks, accessibility
- **LaTeX quality**: Math mode usage, chemical formulas, units
- **Structure validation**: Required fields, answer consistency

#### User Experience Features
```bash
# Interactive format recommendation
setwise questions recommend-format

# Comprehensive validation with suggestions
setwise questions validate file.yaml --verbose --auto-suggest

# Workflow-specific help
setwise questions workflow first-time
```
